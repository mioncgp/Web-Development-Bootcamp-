<body>
    The internet is just a long piece of wire that connects all the computers in the world.
    When you type "google" in your browser, this request goes to an ISP which in turn relays the request 
    to A DNS server. A DNS server is like a notebook/database where all the names are mapped to the IP adresses of the websites.
